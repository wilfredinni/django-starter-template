## ðŸš€ Quick Start

The recommended way to get started is by using the Dev Container feature in VS Code.

### Prerequisites
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for VS Code.

### Setup Steps

1.  **Use the GitHub Template:**
    - Click the green `Use this template` button on the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/wilfredinni/django-starter-template) to create your own repository.

2.  **Open in VS Code:**
    - Clone your new repository and open its folder in Visual Studio Code.

3.  **Check the Setup Guide:**
    - Before proceeding, check the **`Todo Tree`** view in the VS Code sidebar for a guided list of initial setup tasks.

4.  **Reopen in Container:**
    - When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"** to build and start the dev environment.

5.  **Create a Superuser:**
    - Once the container is running, open a new VS Code terminal (`Ctrl+` or `Terminal > New Terminal`).
    - Run the following command:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

6.  **Start the Server:**
    - In the same terminal, run:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

Your API is now running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3.  **Set up your environment:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your settings
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies and run migrations:**

    ```bash
    poetry install
    poetry run migrate
    ```

5.  **Launch the development server:**

    ```bash
    poetry run server
    ```

That's it! Your new Django project is live at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
