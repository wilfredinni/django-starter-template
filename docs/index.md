## ðŸš€ Quick Start

The recommended way to get started is by using the Dev Container feature in VS Code.

### Prerequisites
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for VS Code.

### Setup Steps

1.  **Use the GitHub Template:**

    Click the green `Use this template` button on the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/wilfredinni/django-starter-template) to create your own repository.

2.  **Open in VS Code:**

    Clone your new repository and open its folder in Visual Studio Code.

3.  **Check the Setup Guide:**

    Before proceeding, check the **`Todo Tree`** view in the VS Code sidebar for a guided list of initial setup tasks.

4.  **Reopen in Container:**

    When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"** to build and start the dev environment. This will configure Redis, Celery, PostgreSQL, install dependencies, and migrate the database.

5.  **Create a Superuser:**

    Run python `manage.py createsuperuser` to create an admin user for accessing the Django admin interface.

6.  **Start the Server:**

    Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the development server.

Your API is now running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
