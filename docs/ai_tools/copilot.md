5. Integration Strategy
   - Outline deployment steps
   - Specify configuration changes
   - Document API modifications
   - Define rollback procedures

Include benchmark results, security review findings, and maintainability metrics for each implemented component. Prioritize clean architecture and SOLID principles.
```

### Refactor Prompt (`refactor.prompt.md`)

**Purpose:** Use this prompt when you want to refactor existing code. It directs Copilot to focus on performance, security, maintainability, and readability, providing a structured approach to code improvement.

```markdown
As a senior software engineer, analyze the provided code and suggest specific refactoring improvements focusing on these key aspects:

1. Performance:
- Identify algorithmic inefficiencies
- Optimize resource usage and memory management
- Suggest caching strategies where applicable
- Highlight potential bottlenecks

2. Security:
- Review for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Ensure proper input validation
- Verify authentication and authorization
- Check for secure data handling

3. Maintainability:
- Apply SOLID principles
- Improve code organization and structure
- Reduce technical debt
- Enhance modularity and reusability

4. Readability:
- Follow language-specific style guides
- Apply consistent naming conventions
- Add meaningful comments and documentation
- Break down complex logic into smaller functions

For each suggested improvement:
- Explain the rationale
- Provide a code example
- Highlight potential trade-offs
- Consider the impact on existing functionality

Please provide the code you want to refactor, and specify any constraints or requirements specific to your project's context.
```

### Security Prompt (`security.prompt.md`)

**Purpose:** Use this prompt to conduct a security review of your API implementation. It guides Copilot to check for authentication, authorization, input validation, rate limiting, and security monitoring.

```markdown
Conduct a comprehensive security review of the REST API implementation according to industry best practices. Review and implement the following security controls:

Authentication & Authorization:
- Verify JWT/OAuth2 authentication is properly implemented for all endpoints
- Confirm role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced
- Check token validation, expiration, and refresh mechanisms
- Ensure sensitive endpoints require appropriate scopes/permissions

Input Validation & Sanitization:
- Validate request parameters, headers, and body content
- Implement strong input validation using a schema validator (e.g. JSON Schema)
- Apply appropriate encoding for special characters
- Prevent SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks

Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection:
- Set appropriate rate limits per endpoint/user
- Implement exponential backoff for failed attempts
- Configure API gateway throttling rules
- Document rate limit headers and responses

Security Monitoring:
- Enable detailed logging for authentication attempts
- Track and alert on suspicious activity patterns
- Log all administrative actions and data modifications
- Implement audit trails for sensitive operations
- Set up automated security scanning and penetration testing

Follow OWASP API Security Top 10 guidelines and document any findings in a security assessment report.
