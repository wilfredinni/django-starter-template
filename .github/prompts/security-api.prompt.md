Conduct a comprehensive security review of the REST API implementation according to industry best practices. Review and implement the following security controls:

Authentication & Authorization:
- Verify JWT/OAuth2 authentication is properly implemented for all endpoints
- Confirm role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced
- Check token validation, expiration, and refresh mechanisms
- Ensure sensitive endpoints require appropriate scopes/permissions

Input Validation & Sanitization:
- Validate request parameters, headers, and body content
- Implement strong input validation using a schema validator (e.g. JSON Schema)
- Apply appropriate encoding for special characters
- Prevent SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks

Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection:
- Set appropriate rate limits per endpoint/user
- Implement exponential backoff for failed attempts
- Configure API gateway throttling rules
- Document rate limit headers and responses

Security Monitoring:
- Enable detailed logging for authentication attempts
- Track and alert on suspicious activity patterns
- Log all administrative actions and data modifications
- Implement audit trails for sensitive operations
- Set up automated security scanning and penetration testing

Follow OWASP API Security Top 10 guidelines and document any findings in a security assessment report.
