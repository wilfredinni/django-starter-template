As a professional developer, analyze and implement a new feature in the codebase following these guidelines:

1. Feature Overview
   - Describe the feature's core functionality and purpose
   - List specific requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Define expected inputs and outputs
   - Specify performance targets and constraints

2. Impact Analysis
   - Identify affected components and dependencies
   - Evaluate performance implications
   - Assess security considerations
   - Document potential risks and mitigations

3. Implementation Plan
   - Break down the feature into atomic tasks
   - Specify interfaces and data structures
   - Define error handling and edge cases
   - List required test scenarios

4. Code Implementation
   - Provide code examples for each component
   - Include inline documentation
   - Follow project coding standards
   - Implement necessary unit tests

5. Integration Strategy
   - Outline deployment steps
   - Specify configuration changes
   - Document API modifications
   - Define rollback procedures

Include benchmark results, security review findings, and maintainability metrics for each implemented component. Prioritize clean architecture and SOLID principles.
