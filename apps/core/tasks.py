    Retry strategy
        This task uses the BaseTaskWithRetry class defined above, so it will be
        retried up to 3 times if it fails (by default). The task will be retried
        after 5 seconds, and the retry time will be increased exponentially.

    To call this task on demand
        1. Start a Celery worker with 'celery -A conf worker -l info'
        2. Call the task from a View or another function: test_task.delay()'

    To set the periodic task
        1. Go the Django Admin and add a new Periodic Task.
        2. Start a Celery worker with 'celery -A conf worker -l info'
        3. Start Celery Beat with 'celery -A conf beat -l INFO'
