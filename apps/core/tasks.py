    This task can be executed periodically using Celery Beat, and/or on demand.

    Parameters:
        self: The task instance itself.

    Retry strategy
        This task uses the BaseTaskWithRetry class defined above, so it will be
        retried up to 3 times if it fails (by default). The task will be retried
        after 5 seconds, and the retry time will be increased exponentially.

    To call this task on demand
        1. Start a Celery worker with 'poetry run worker'
        2. Call the task from a View or another function as test_task.delay()'

    To set the periodic task
        1. Go the Django Admin and add a new Periodic Task.
        2. Start a Celery worker with 'poetry run worker'
        3. Start Celery Beat with 'poetry run beat'
