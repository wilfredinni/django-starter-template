## Requirements

- </> VS Code
- 🐋 Docker
- 🐳 Docker Compose


## How to use

1. Clone the repo or use it as a template to start a new project.
![Use as template](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/use-this-template-button.png)
1. Open the project in VS Code.
1. If you installed the recommended extensions, open `Todo Tree` in the sidebar. It will guide you trough the first steps setting up your project, like changing the name of the container, adjusting your URLS, etc.
![todo](/static/TODO.png)
1. Use `env.example` to create a `.env` file.
1. Hit `CTL/CMD + Shift + p` and select `Reopen in container`. This will:
    - Create a dev container.
    - Install the dependencies.
    - Setup your PostgreSQL database.
    - Setup a Redis server.
    - Migrate the database.
1. Create your super user with `python manage.py createsuperuser`.
1. Run the project with `python manage.py reserver`.
1. Work as usual.


## Commands

This template comes with some shortcuts so you don't have to memorize how to start the workers:

- `poetry run worker`: to start a new Celery worker.
- `poetry run beat`: to start your periodic tasks.

And if you feel like it, you can also use:

- `poetry run server` instead of `python manage.py runserver`
- `poetry run makemigrations` instead of `python manage.py makemigrations`
- `poetry run migrate` instead of `python manage.py migrate`
