## Requirements

- 💻 VS Code
- 🐋 Docker
- 🐳 Docker Compose


## How to use

1. Use [GitHub's template feature](https://github.com/new?template_name=django-starter-template&template_owner=wilfredinni) (recommended) or clone repository and delete the `.git` folder.
1. Open the project in VS Code.
1. If you installed the recommended extensions, open `Todo Tree` in the sidebar. It will [guide you trough the first steps](/static/TODO.png) setting up your project, like changing the name of the container, adjusting your URLS, etc.
1. Hit `CTL/CMD + Shift + p` and select `Reopen in container`. This will:
    - Create a dev container.
    - Setup a Redis server.
    - Setup your PostgreSQL database.
    - Add a development `.env` file.
    - Install the dependencies.
    - Migrate the database.
1. Create your super user with `python manage.py createsuperuser`.
1. Run the project with `python manage.py reserver`.
1. Work as usual.

├── core/                   # Core functionality and base models
│   ├── models.py          # Contains BaseModel and SoftDeleteBaseModel
│   ├── managers.py        # Custom model managers

    └── tests/           # Comprehensive test suite
```

## Models

### BaseModel

All models in the project can inherit from `BaseModel` which provides:

- `created_at`: Timestamp of record creation
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update

```python
class MyModel(BaseModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
```

### SoftDeleteBaseModel

Extends `BaseModel` with soft deletion capability:
- `deleted_at`: Timestamp of soft deletion
- Includes `restore()` method to undelete records
- Custom manager that filters out deleted records by default

```python
class MyModel(SoftDeleteBaseModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
```

## Authentication

The template uses Knox for token-based authentication:

### Available Endpoints

- `POST /auth/create/` - Create a new user
- `POST /auth/login/` - Log in and receive token
- `POST /auth/logout/` - Invalidate current token
- `POST /auth/logoutall/` - Invalidate all tokens
- `GET/PUT/PATCH /auth/profile/` - Manage user profile

### Rate Limiting

- Login attempts: 5 per minute
- User operations: 1000 per day
- Anonymous operations: 100 per day

## Advanced Usage

### Celery Tasks

Base task class with retry capabilities:

```python
from apps.core.tasks import BaseTaskWithRetry

@shared_task(base=BaseTaskWithRetry)
def my_task():
    # Will retry 3 times with exponential backoff
    pass
```

### Environment Variables

The template supports multiple environment configurations:

- Development: `.env` file created automatically
- Production: See `.env.example` for required variables

### Testing

- Tests are organized by app in `tests/` directories
- Uses pytest fixtures for common testing scenarios
- Includes comprehensive test coverage for authentication
- Includes examples of API endpoint testing

### API Documentation

- Swagger UI available at `/api/schema/swagger-ui/`
- Automatic schema generation with drf-spectacular
- Includes example requests and responses
- Documents authentication requirements

### Security Features

- Email-based authentication
- Token-based authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- CORS configuration
- Debug mode control
- Secure password hashing

## Development Best Practices

1. **Model Creation**
   - Inherit from `BaseModel` for basic timestamping
   - Use `SoftDeleteBaseModel` when deletion tracking is needed
   - Implement custom managers in `managers.py` in each app

2. **API Views**
   - Use DRF class-based views
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Add rate limiting
   - Document with drf-spectacular decorators

3. **Testing**
   - Write tests for all models and views
   - Use pytest fixtures
   - Test both success and failure cases
   - Test authentication and permissions

4. **Task Processing**
   - Use `BaseTaskWithRetry` for resilient tasks
   - Configure retry policies appropriately
   - Use Celery Beat for scheduled tasks

## Commands 🛠️

This section provides a list of useful commands to help you manage and develop your Django project efficiently.

### Celery Tasks

- `poetry run worker`: to start a new Celery worker.
- `poetry run beat`: to start your periodic tasks.

### Test commands:

- `pytest` to run the tests.
- `pytest --cov` to run the tests with coverage.
- `pytest --cov --cov-report=html` to run the tests with coverage and generate a HTML report.

### You can also use

- `poetry run server` instead of `python manage.py runserver`
- `poetry run makemigrations` instead of `python manage.py makemigrations`
- `poetry run migrate` instead of `python manage.py migrate`
- `poetry run create_dev_env` to create a development `.env` file
