## Supported Versions

As an open source product, only the latest major version will be patched for security vulnerabilities. Previous versions of the Django Starter Template will likely not be retroactively patched.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please email carlos@pythoncheatsheet.org with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and if known, mitigation for the issue.

Once the vulnerability has been confirmed, it will be fixed as soon as possible if feasible.
